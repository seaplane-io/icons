# Seaplane Serverless Architecture Icons

In this repository you will find catagorized folders that contain Seaplane IO
Serverless architecture icons. We use these to communicate serverless application
designs and deployments. They are not specific to Seaplane, or our products, so
we hope that you find them useful too!

The icons are designed to be easily incorporated in diagrams, whitepapers,
presentations, datasheets, posters, or any technical material.

## Diagramming

We use diagrams.net for creating diagrams. You can start a new diagram
with the Seaplane library loaded using this
[diagrams.net URL](https://app.diagrams.net/?splash=0&clibs=Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseaplane-io%2Ficons%2Fmaster%2Fclient%2FSeaplane%EF%BC%8FClient;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseaplane-io%2Ficons%2Fmaster%2Fcompute%2FSeaplane%EF%BC%8FCompute;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseaplane-io%2Ficons%2Fmaster%2Fdatabase%2FSeaplane%EF%BC%8FDatabase;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseaplane-io%2Ficons%2Fmaster%2Fdeveloper%2FSeaplane%EF%BC%8FDeveloper;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseaplane-io%2Ficons%2Fmaster%2Fgeneral%2FSeaplane%EF%BC%8FGeneral;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseaplane-io%2Ficons%2Fmaster%2Finnovations%2FSeaplane%EF%BC%8FInnovations;Uhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/seaplane-io/icons/master/management/Seaplane%EF%BC%8FManagement;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseaplane-io%2Ficons%2Fmaster%2Fnetwork%2FSeaplane%EF%BC%8FNetwork;Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fseaplane-io%2Ficons%2Fmaster%2Fstorage%2FSeaplane%EF%BC%8FStorage).

The desktop version of the software doesn't support importing all the files in
one go from a URL. Instead you will need to import the individual library files.
These files can be found within each library or collected in a
[zip file](https://github.com/seaplane-io/icons/releases/download/v1.0/seaplane-icons.zip)
on the [release page](https://github.com/seaplane-io/icons/releases).
